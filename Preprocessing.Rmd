# Project Objective: 

The overarching objective of this project is to develop a model to predict hospital readmission based on key characteristics from the patientâ€™s first visit. 
Our goal is to compare several statistical learning methods and their test performance and determine which model will most accurately predict whether or not someone will be readmitted at a later time (within a 2-year time frame, given the structure of the data).

#### load libraries

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

#### read in data

```{r}
admission <- read.csv("data/HDHI Admission data.csv")
mortality <- read.csv("data/HDHI Mortality Data.csv")
pollution <- read.csv("data/HDHI Pollution Data.csv")
```

#### to do: 
- remove features unrelated to cardiac issues
-
